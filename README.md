## Description
Google Book Search is an application that uses the Google Books API to let the user search for any book title and returns results for the title searched. The user can signup for an account and pick and choose books to save to their account from their search results.

This app was refactored from an existing, fully functional MERN app setup with a RESTful API. The existing RESTful API was refactored to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server with GraphQL queries and mutations. The app is also built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node. Refactoring to a GraphQL API allows to reduce the number of calls to the server and avoids overfetching of data.
